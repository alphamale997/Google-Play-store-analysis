# Google-Play-store-analysis
Mining user review data to determine how people feel about your product, brand, 
or service can be done using a technique called sentiment analysis. 
User reviews for apps can be analyzed to identify if the mood is positive, negative or neutral about that app. 
For example, positive words in an app review might include words such as 'amazing', 'friendly', 'good', 'great', and 'love'. 
Negative words might be words like 'malware', 'hate', 'problem', 'refund', and 'incompetent'.

In this project, I analyzed over ten thousand apps from the Google Play Store. 
I have analysed the various factors like size of the app, Price of the app, Category and the impact it has on the downloads.
Popularity of paid apps vs free apps etc.
